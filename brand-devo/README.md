# Dali Brand Devo

Devo's main brand schemes for Dali's design system.

This package contains the schemes as `json` files, required to generate Devo's **light** and **dark** brands.

## Quick start

To generate the brands from the available schemas, this project uses the `dit` CLI from [tokens-cli](../tokens-cli/). Please refer to the `dit` package [documentation](../tokens-cli/README.md) for further information.

```sh
## Go to package directory
cd brand-devo
## Generate tokens for Devo's brand
npm run dist
```
The brands are now available in the `dist/` folder.
